# Data-Engineering-Capstone-Project
Overview
This Capstone Project requires learners to work with the following technologies to manage an ETL process for a Loan Application dataset and a Credit Card dataset: Python (Pandas, advanced modules e.g., Matplotlib), MariaDB, Apache Spark (Spark Core, Spark SQL), and Python Visualization and Analytics libraries. Learners will be expected to set up their environments and perform installations on their local machines. 

The Credit Card System database is an independent system developed for managing activities such as registering new customers and approving or canceling requests, etc., using the architecture.
A credit card is issued to users to enact the payment system. It allows the cardholder to access financial services in exchange for the holder's promise to pay for them later. Below are three files that contain the customer’s transaction information and inventories in the credit card information.

CDW_SAPP_CUSTOMER.JSON: This file has the existing customer details.
CDW_SAPP_CREDITCARD.JSON: This file contains all credit card transaction information.
CDW_SAPP_BRANCH.JSON: Each branch’s information and details are recorded in this file.
